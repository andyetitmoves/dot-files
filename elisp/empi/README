Preferably byte compile all files and add this directory along with the defs
subdirectory to the load path. When using for the first time, load empi-core.el
and customize the `empi' group. Please read the commentary using the
'See also empi-core' link in the empi customization group to get an idea about
EMPI, before proceeding with the customization.

cust-eg.html shows an example snapshot of the filled customization
buffer. (thanks to htmlfontify.el :) This also shows a sample customization for
empi-player-alist, a "necessary" customization.
