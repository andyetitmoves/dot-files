==================
Pidgin Copy Status
==================

Version 1.0

------------
Introduction
------------

This is a small plugin for Pidgin to copy the status of the selected buddy in
the buddy list to the clipboard. While the same can be done with the status text
got in `Get Info', this usually takes some time as other information for the
buddy is retrieved from the network.

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

-----
Usage
-----

The plugin registers an action with Pidgin, which can be accessed from the menu
at `Tools->Copy Status->Copy' in the recent versions of Pidgin.

To bind this to a key, you will first need to edit your gtkrc file.
Add this line:

gtk-can-change-accels = 1

to your ~/.pidgin/gtkrc-2.0 (The same can be achieved by the use of the `Pidgin
GTK+ Theme Control' plugin). You might have to restart Pidgin. Then place the
mouse over the menu entry, and press the keybinding you want. (After you
configure, you can remove the above setting in the gtkrc file).
